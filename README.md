An elliptic curve offering 128 bits of security and designed for use with the elliptic curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme.

The goal of this library is to provide a NuGet package targeting .NET Standard 2.0 that is compatible with Blazor WebAssembly.

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Whyvra.Crypto.X25519
```

## Usage

```csharp
var curve25519 = new Curve25519();
var alicePrivate = curve25519.CreateRandomPrivateKey();
var alicePublic = curve25519.GetPublicKey(alicePrivate);

var bobPrivate = curve25519.CreateRandomPrivateKey();
var bobPublic = curve25519.GetPublicKey(bobPrivate);

var aliceShared = curve25519.GetSharedSecret(alicePrivate, bobPublic);
var bobShared = curve25519.GetSharedSecret(bobPrivate, alicePublic);
var equal = aliceShared.SequenceEqual(bobShared);
```
